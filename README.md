Recreating an Amiga500 with FPGA (consolidated repository)

The Minimig (short for "Mini Amiga") is a remarkable open-source hardware project designed to replicate the beloved Amiga 500 home computer, an iconic system from the late 1980s and early 1990s. Conceived by enthusiast Dennis van Weeren in 2005, the Minimig project began as a labor of love to faithfully recreate the Amigaâ€™s unique architecture on an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). Over time, it evolved with community contributions and open-source improvements, resulting in a versatile, accessible, and compact recreation of the original Amiga 500 that enthusiasts worldwide could use to relive and preserve classic Amiga software and games.

## Motivation
Recently I've been busy building a Minimig board. The Minimig is an FPGA-based implementation of the original Commodore Amiga 500 hardware.

This repository, together with the document available at http://www.theretrohacker.com/2022/12/20/an-fppga-based-amiga-the-minimig/ is my attempt to consolidate the very disperse documentation about the minimig and offer a concise guide if you want to build a board. Most of the websites that hosted files required are also offline currently.
