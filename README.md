Recreating an Amiga500 with FPGA (consolidated repository)

## Motivation
Recently I've been busy building a Minimig board. The Minimig is an FPGA-based implementation of the original Commodore Amiga 500 hardware.

This repository, together with the document available at http://www.theretrohacker.com/2022/12/20/an-fppga-based-amiga-the-minimig/ is my attempt to consolidate the very disperse documentation about the minimig and offer a concise guide if you want to build a board. Most of the websites that hosted files required are also offline currently.
